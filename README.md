Original Deerflow Architecture:
![Architecture Diagram](./assets/architecture.png)

The system employs a streamlined workflow with the following enhanced components:

1. **Coordinator**: The entry point that manages the workflow lifecycle
   - Initiates the research process based on user input
   - Delegates tasks to the planner when appropriate
   - Acts as the primary interface between the user and the system

2. **Enhanced Planner**: Strategic component with intelligent query processing
   - **Smart Query Splitting**: Automatically breaks down complex queries into multiple optimized sub-queries
   - Analyzes research objectives and creates structured execution plans
   - Determines if enough context is available or if more research is needed
   - Manages parallel research streams for comprehensive coverage

3. **Enhanced Research Team**: Specialized agents with Bright Data integration:
   - **Advanced Researcher**: Conducts web searches using Bright Data's enterprise APIs, with intelligent query distribution and parallel processing
   - **Enhanced Crawler**: Utilizes Bright Data's crawling infrastructure for reliable data collection
   - **Coder**: Handles code analysis, execution, and technical tasks using Python REPL tool
   - Each agent has access to enterprise-grade tools optimized for their role

4. **Reporter**: Final stage processor for research outputs
   - Aggregates findings from multiple parallel research streams
   - Processes and structures the collected information with enhanced context
   - Generates comprehensive research reports with richer insights

## Text-to-Speech Integration

BrightFlow includes a Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature that allows you to convert research reports to speech. This feature uses the volcengine TTS API to generate high-quality audio from text. Features like speed, volume, and pitch are also customizable.

### Using the TTS API

You can access the TTS functionality through the `/api/tts` endpoint:

```bash
# Example API call using curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/api/tts' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "text": "This is a test of the text-to-speech functionality.",
    "speed_ratio": 1.0,
    "volume_ratio": 1.0,
    "pitch_ratio": 1.0
}' \
--output speech.mp3
```

## Development

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_workflow.py

# Run with coverage
make coverage
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linting
make lint

# Format code
make format
```

### Debugging with LangGraph Studio

BrightFlow uses LangGraph for its workflow architecture. You can use LangGraph Studio to debug and visualize the enhanced workflow in real-time.

#### Running LangGraph Studio Locally

BrightFlow includes a `langgraph.json` configuration file that defines the graph structure and dependencies for the LangGraph Studio. This file points to the workflow graphs defined in the project and automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file.

##### Mac

```bash
# Install uv package manager if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies and start the LangGraph server
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.12 langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

##### Windows / Linux

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"

# Start the LangGraph server
langgraph dev
```

After starting the LangGraph server, you'll see several URLs in the terminal:

- API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs

Open the Studio UI link in your browser to access the debugging interface and see the enhanced BrightFlow workflow in action.

## Docker

You can also run this project with Docker.

First, you need read the [configuration](docs/configuration_guide.md) below. Make sure `.env`, `.conf.yaml` files are ready with your Bright Data credentials.

Second, to build a Docker image of your own web server:

```bash
docker build -t bright-flow-api .
```

Final, start up a docker container running the web server:

```bash
# Replace bright-flow-api-app with your preferred container name
docker run -d -t -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env --name bright-flow-api-app bright-flow-api

# stop the server
docker stop bright-flow-api-app
```

### Docker Compose (include both backend and frontend)

BrightFlow provides a docker-compose setup to easily run both the backend and frontend together:

```bash
# building docker image
docker compose build

# start the server
docker compose up
```
